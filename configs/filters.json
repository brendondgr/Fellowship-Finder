    "system_instructions": "I am deeply invested in the field of Artificial Intelligence and its practical applications across diverse domains. My primary research interests lie at the intersection of AI and healthcare, with a particular focus on robotic surgery. In addition to this core interest, I also enjoy exploring personalized medicine and investigating the potential of large language models (LLMs) in a variety of contexts. Nonetheless, my work remains centered on areas such as robotic surgery, medical imaging, and medical LLMs. I am not interested in pursuing research related to finance, conservation, or bioinformatics."
